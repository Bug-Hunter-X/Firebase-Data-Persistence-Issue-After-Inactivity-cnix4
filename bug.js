In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't persisting despite successful writes to the database using the Firebase Realtime Database. The application functioned correctly on initial runs, but subsequent uses failed to update the database.  I confirmed the data was correctly formatted, the authentication was working properly, and the database rules allowed the write operation. The problem only appeared after a period of inactivity or device restart.
