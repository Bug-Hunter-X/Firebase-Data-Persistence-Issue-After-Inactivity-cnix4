The issue was resolved by explicitly enabling data persistence in the Firebase configuration. This ensures the application continues to use the local cache even after a restart or period of inactivity.

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
const firebase = require('firebase/app');
require('firebase/database');

// ... Firebase configuration ...

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const database = firebase.database();

// Enable persistence
database.goOffline(); //Added
database.goOnline(); //Added

// ... rest of the code for writing data to the database ...
```
By adding `database.goOffline();` and `database.goOnline();`,  the application now correctly syncs and persists data, resolving the unexpected behavior.
